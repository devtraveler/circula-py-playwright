# Web Test Automation Framework

This is a web test automation framework using Python and Playwright, structured with the Page Object Model (POM).


### Summary

This framework is designed to be modular and easily extensible. You can add more page objects under the `pages` directory and corresponding tests in the `tests` directory. The `setup.bat` file simplifies the environment setup, and the `requirements.txt` file ensures that all necessary dependencies are installed.

You can now use this structure to start building and running your automated tests with Playwright in Python!


## Project Structure

- `pages/`: Contains page objects representing the web pages.
- `tests/`: Contains test scripts that execute the test cases.
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions that support the test scripts.
- `setup.bat`: A batch file to set up the environment.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing the Python dependencies.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `setup.bat` to install dependencies and set up the virtual environment.
3. Run `pytest` to execute the test cases.
